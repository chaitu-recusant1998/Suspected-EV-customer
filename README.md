# Suspected Ev Customers

• Accomplished the prediction of 5,985 potential new electric vehicle owners from a pool of over 180,000 customers by developing and implementing an unsupervised machine learning model utilizing k-means clustering algorithm and setting a threshold filter based on affluent mosaic demographic types identified through research as most likely to own EVs.

• Led extensive exploratory data analysis including statistical techniques like interquartile range calculations and insightful data visualizations like consumption over time plots to uncover variability, trends and relationships within the multivariate customer dataset containing usage, billing and demographics information.

• Directed the end-to-end machine learning modeling process from data preprocessing like scaling for k-means distance calculations to the systematic determination of the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method on within cluster sum of squares values, resulting in a 3-cluster solution.

• Improved refinement of the initial list of 16,353 potential EV owners predicted by the unsupervised clustering model down to a more manageable 5,985 customers by setting a filtering threshold to target only mosaic types identifying affluent and wealthy demographics based on research showing a higher likelihood of EV adoption among high income households.

• Evaluated the performance of the k-means clustering model by comparing the resulting 3 clusters on usage and billing data patterns, analyzing summary statistics like mean values for each cluster and visualizing consumption over time, enabling the identification of the suspicious high-consumption cluster most likely to own EVs.

• Achieved impactful and actionable insights into Energia's overall customer base by leveraging unsupervised learning techniques like clustering for customer segmentation and developing data-driven filters to refine segments, providing a solid analytical foundation to inform marketing and customer acquisition strategies.
